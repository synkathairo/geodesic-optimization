# geodesic-optimization

Zhang and Sra describe methods for utilizing geodesically convex optimization[^1]. Also see Vishnoi's article[^2] which explains the topic at an introductory level.

This repository contains an adaptation of these methods.

Part of a course project for CSCI-GA.2945/ MATH-GA.2012 Convex and Nonsmooth Optimization at New York University.
